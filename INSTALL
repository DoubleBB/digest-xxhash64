       Installation instructions for Digest::xxHash64

To install this module, just do:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install  (this step may need to be done as the superuser)

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't require
the "./" notation, you can do this:

  perl Build.PL
  Build
  Build test
  Build install

In crtain verions of Windows, to execute successfully these commands
in command window, you may need to open the CMD window as Administrator.

The important thing is that the "Build" script gets executed and that
you pass it the "test", "install", etc. arguments.
